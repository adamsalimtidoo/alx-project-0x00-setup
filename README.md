### Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

1. Understand how to scaffold a Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Learn Next.js folder structure and organization best practices
3. Implement basic routing in Next.js (Pages Router)
4. Create reusable React components with TypeScript
5. Work with TypeScript interfaces for component props
6. Manage assets and static files in Next.js
7. Develop an understanding of component composition
8. Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
9. Set up and configure ESLint for code quality
